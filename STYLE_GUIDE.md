# Style Guide

This style guide outlines the conventions used in the TaskMaster project, including coding standards, file structure, and naming conventions. Adherence to these guidelines is important for the maintainability and readability of the codebase.

## Language

The TaskMaster project uses JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The latest version of each should be used, and code should be written to be compatible with the most recent version of each.

## Naming Conventions

- Variable and function names should be descriptive and use snake_case.
- Class names should be written in PascalCase.
- Constants should be written in ALL_CAPS.

## File Structure

- The backend should be stored in the backend folder, and the frontend in the frontend folder.
- Each module should have its own folder within the appropriate section, with a descriptive name.
- All code should be organized in a logical and consistent manner, with related files grouped together.

## Git Commits

- Commits should have descriptive messages that accurately describe the changes made.
- Commits should be atomic, with each one representing a single change or group of related changes.
- Large or complex changes should be broken down into multiple smaller commits.

## Testing

Unit tests should be written for all code, and should cover all relevant edge cases. Tests should be placed in the same folder as the code being tested, and should have descriptive names.

## Code Review

All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other member of the development team before being merged into the main branch. Code reviews should be thorough, and should focus on ensuring that code meets the standards outlined in this guide and is free of bugs.

## Dependencies

All dependencies should be managed using a package manager such as npm or yarn. The latest stable version of each dependency should be used, and all dependencies should be listed in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section of the appropriate `package.json` file.

## Documentation

All code should be documented with inline comments where necessary. Comments should describe what the code does, and should be written in a clear and concise manner. Additional documentation should be added to the `README.md` file if necessary.
