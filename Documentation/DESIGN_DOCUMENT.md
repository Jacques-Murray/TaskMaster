# Design Document for TaskMaster

## Introduction

This document outlines the design of the To-Do Application, including the architecture, data structures, and user interface. It provides a detailed plan for the development of the software and serves as a guide for the development team.

## Architecture

The To-Do Application will be a single-page web application that uses a client-server architecture. The client-side will be built using React and will communicate with the server-side using a RESTful API. The server-side will be built using Flask and will use SQLite as the database to store user and task data.

## Data Structures

The following data structures will be used to store user and task data:

- User: contains information about a user, including username, email address, password hash, and any other relevant information.
- Task: contains information about a task, including task name, due date, project, and completion status.
- Project: contains information about a project, including project name and due date.

## User Interface

The To-Do Application will have a simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to manage their tasks. The main screen will consist of two main sections: a list of tasks and a task detail view.

- Task list: displays a list of all tasks, organized by due date or project. Users can mark tasks as complete, edit task details, or delete tasks.
- Task detail view: displays detailed information about a task, including task name, due date, project, and completion status. Users can edit task details or mark the task as complete.

## Conclusion

The design outlined in this document will serve as a guide for the development of the To-Do Application. The architecture, data structures, and user interface will help ensure that the final product is easy to use and meets the needs of users. The design will also provide a foundation for future enhancements and additions to the software.
