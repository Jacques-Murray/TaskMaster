# Test Plan for TaskMaster

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline the test plan for the To-Do Application. It provides a detailed description of the testing process and the tests that will be performed to ensure that the software meets its requirements and works as expected.

## Test Objectives

The following objectives will guide the testing process:

1. Verify that the user interface is easy to use and meets the needs of users.
2. Ensure that the To-Do Application correctly stores and retrieves task data from the database.
3. Verify that the To-Do Application accurately updates and displays task data.
4. Ensure that the To-Do Application provides the necessary functionality to manage tasks, including adding, editing, marking complete, and deleting tasks.
5. Verify that the RESTful API correctly communicates with the server-side and client-side.

## Test Approach

The following testing approach will be used to meet the test objectives:

1. Unit testing: individual components and functions will be tested to ensure that they work as expected.
2. Integration testing: the To-Do Application will be tested as a whole to ensure that all components work together correctly.
3. User acceptance testing: the To-Do Application will be tested by users to ensure that it meets their needs and is easy to use.

## Test Cases

The following test cases will be performed to meet the test objectives:

1. Verify that the task list displays the correct task data and allows users to add, edit, mark complete, and delete tasks.
2. Ensure that the task detail view displays the correct task data and allows users to edit task details and mark the task as complete.
3. Verify that the To-Do Application correctly stores and retrieves task data from the database.
4. Ensure that the To-Do Application accurately updates and displays task data, including task completion status.
5. Verify that the RESTful API correctly communicates with the server-side and client-side.

## Test Environment

The following software and hardware will be used for testing:

- Operating system: Windows, MacOS, or Linux
- Web browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari
- Server: Flask
- Database: SQLite

## Test Scheduling

Testing will begin after the software has been developed and will continue until all test objectives have been met. The exact schedule will depend on the pace of development and the availability of resources.

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a detailed description of the testing process for the To-Do Application. The test objectives, test approach, test cases, test environment, and test scheduling will help ensure that the software is tested thoroughly and meets the needs of users. The results of testing will be used to identify and correct any issues before the software is released.
